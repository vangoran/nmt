You know that what I do is I write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather <unk> and never no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that came to you.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a very complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When he was beaten up to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she could go into the bathroom in the hotel room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I am <unk> that we never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've been found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and we take care of it, and we take care of his family, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of the ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today today about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to claim that humans are not separated from the nature and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I put them around around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> over the other <unk> of snow after year.
<unk> are born when they come from glaciers or they break down the ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I am breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts, it releases freshwater rich on minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and will not exist that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the ice that's photographing is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last shots I'd like to show you is an iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's very frequent to get an B15 iceberg to really witness an B15 iceberg to see.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the way the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it begins to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg on Greenland, average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one -- a baby Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding of it, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X chromosome of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome is joined by the X chromosome of the <unk>
Both <unk> and it begins life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity that I can find two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people came up to the anatomy -- namely, human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, we <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physics physics doesn't fit into male with male schemes and female feminine me?"
On the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that is not <unk> in common or male ways.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene from the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that will become <unk>
And then in life, in life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body is developed following a <unk> course.
When you go back, the baby has a little bit like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know his structure -- I think it was a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
That's why sex is a bit complicated -- not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old 19-year-old and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and she was wearing sex with her, and I had just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th century and in the uterus and the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to 19 years old when he started to have been able to have <unk> medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what's known as <unk> which is to say, have tissue tissue wrapped up in <unk>
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies -- and they are <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> they are tested for surgery -- it's not to be able to get rid of a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are tested to various surgeries is that they're an threat for our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it's black to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very dramatic ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people in the same body.
The highest case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What test are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there are no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who have this line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these <unk> categories were we thought were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they're much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology is going to be.
We go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> from them in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to engage with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if he still moved it yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to address the dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so courageous and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single watching that musical <unk> music, and not for music, which is totally <unk>
It's why I happened in <unk> with the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they had it <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful for 200 years.
And as everyone remembers -- what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old people in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of a birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be the political power of political power by the father of the father and then to the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we do science <unk>
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed away by a vague <unk> of birth to birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence we were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what years next?
And women are <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
Again, people of color that were going to go to the <unk> coincidence.
We see the same with the Slow Movement movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean that at five years they were supposed to allow you to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
Henry, at the contrary, was born in term: was born on June 1 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to the <unk> right to the vote, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his hand, doesn't have the same rights that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science is running so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be.
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will be <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome, and to marry a woman you have to have y <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests of <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you to the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be able to deal with this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> which probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the contents of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continue to lead this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context as the Iranian that a man who feels like to be attracted to other men are susceptible to being killed, unless you are willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a couple of years that would give birth twins to then pick it apart and then put it out of your fame.
But when the phone was asked by the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, to tell me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change in the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or how it might be more engaging in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a fan, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> who knew that I was interested in feminism feminism -- <unk> considered me as a <unk> made me an annual <unk>
<unk> what is female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to get rid of the gender stereotypes -- so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more it has something else in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different among the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were so excited to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we raise democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work on, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to do it.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily support the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just went down by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments they were either owners and that the other half still is not in order to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think about is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the expansion of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, and they could build an entirely new apartment building and then when the rules of that place will build their construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to make new reform zones of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 people will come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular regular elections -- <unk> <unk> came up with a platform in which promised which promised and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of standards, such as those rules that say you can't go to and annoy all the residents of apartments.
It took a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies as a norms for <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent me a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met Miami in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, <unk> terrain that, in some cases, worth billions dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site to measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with people who could help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just been going through this <unk> crisis the voting in the Congress for this constitutional constitutional was <unk>
All of the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 passed over again in another voting on <unk>
Immediately after the voting on the age of 21, a <unk> for about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that's being built in Korea <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years and getting the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and maybe allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the last court of instance for this new justice system.
There are urban <unk> which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many businesses that wanted to move in <unk> especially in a place with an open-source zone, and there's a lot of people that would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like change immediately to another place.
There is a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to make the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents that you haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession -- and that's that, I live with <unk>
I love to find, and I was doing more recently, photograph and publish on my blog suits, and they were colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- I usually know my money is going to a good deal, and my mind is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, so I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone that has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I want to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking around TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see you <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be wrong, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right guys, you don't just love you, you will love you.
<unk> <unk> of the kid standing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember them for their <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to get all of what we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tested it again and again when people got close to this week just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to go back certain things.
I don't need to <unk> emotionally to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another suit, colorful and brilliant suit -- if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is completely intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need quite a lot of logical physical physicists, we need quite a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put together to play with them and then we see it <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small kid and didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking lot taught him a worthy lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with a parking lot, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things weird things like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called them theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics for a few years -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit my way into my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of the mechanics <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom here a little bit.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal and a kind of metal, with a trampoline way to trampoline and show up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip and I started working all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> swimming in swimming that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to hear them, or, actually, I want to make it <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of inanimate objects are not just people, and it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to the quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
The lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then they took it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way that it <unk> it was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft thrust, we were able to make it happen, and that we don't have to go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and we don't go at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, watch this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you make your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we put it out, and we turned out the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they ran it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining about this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than showing you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery and the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to make it -- very simple.
We click and, <unk> are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the blueprint up and, with one click, we jump in.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured on what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get from 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you can do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I went out and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump up at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases it and actually that we will.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can create your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we go on -- I've created this function I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got to zoom around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all things really did not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even didn't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice for your artwork and that's represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of a <unk> a flying pixel in.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian -- all the kids in Italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something really interesting about <unk> careers one in the last two decades.
Some of the time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering -- this is a system of control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that real control systems are actually starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're getting <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for <unk> during the summer during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the atoms that are there were to get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a little <unk> <unk> and he said yelling at <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection of the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of the summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, play Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the early afternoon, there are people over here and doing Italian <unk>
It begins the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
You know, people do a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> time a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes it <unk>
That night everybody went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner of the winner and the prime minister of the time.
And then everyone left down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little little tags to track the trash into the system by the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than one year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a little chip, a <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't exist in any place on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we put on a day still stays there.
That if we show them to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and a lot of cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about in the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates a curtain of water with water pixels and water.
If the pixels on the pixels can be written in them, showing patterns, images, <unk>
And in the <unk> the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no gates and no windows, but when you get up to it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you get the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all of the architecture it's gone.
This is working.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I am right here trying to not be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you to leave it -- but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes, and you had to jump out to not <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was very interesting because we as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, where the light changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of giant pixels in which you can get near it, and you can see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light turns out, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> just like motion capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry to the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a farm farm -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody come up a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went through the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign would tell us, we can move from the digital world of the digital world, the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but cover of <unk>
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics of 2012, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go in there.
Like if it was a new digital <unk> in the night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more precise, more exact thing and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better ways, being stronger to get more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most of you?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are being able to get creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many do you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. It makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Talk, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church of <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology -- makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the more interest we care.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 20 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein, which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, it goes down from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> would give you the <unk> think of <unk>
The gut is an beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that they can want to do without your part.
It's really like a quick deal with the bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush turn into the way.
But we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or do it become something different, something perhaps better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single human life, and human life, a small note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you've got to be <unk>
When I first <unk> college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two daughters of the cell cells.
But when organisms happen, things start to change.
It goes in scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year she was happening, getting more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that even <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits her door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of it is a gorgeous <unk> dancer.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's right." George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to stay healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is happening to the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like rocket rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everyone <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> I don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily match longevity.
It doesn't necessarily match the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best <unk> creatures in their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish are empty in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look back at the stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and taken from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for us to happen.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional type of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> when the species, <unk> planets are going to exist, they're going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive possibility to be intriguing and fascinating.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals who are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes on your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly as possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she was 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year to be done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost near 20,000 and in a week.
We didn't have a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and being increasingly in the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us themselves, but they're going to induce them immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trials in course with the flu vaccine in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change cells from their bodies but if they could change cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life to eliminate diabetes to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also take <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a fashion muscle faster than it allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can embrace the attributes that we want to turn the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a hundred thousand years and we can increase it at 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next hundred years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to pick up selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more or more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day that day.
It was the only thing I could talk about with the flight assistants
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem: You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already stepped up the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
So the pilot would take the airplane on the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
The motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words ...
The three most <unk> words I'd heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
I was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to spend anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, "Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we put in things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental watch goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be done in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, "Wow, die doesn't stop fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness would spread in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much talent <unk> --  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood that two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not to die of that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please do not be this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to do is, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're getting the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day she came to her house after he walked and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so that, obviously, graffiti is something we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and sat with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important, you have a very good safe you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the film <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they are marking up with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that had no idea what I was going to do <unk>
I got married with his brother and his father there at the precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to be building a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inside can't be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research, which have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface, and then, with a laser pointer -- draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of an organization and a lot of moving things back to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that I could give it a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world's <unk> world to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken out the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> ride my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of cheap sun <unk> we buy on the remote <unk> for some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
So we took a camera <unk> we put it up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one -- and you build the code -- the software is going down into free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There are no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense courses all night, Tony returned to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking wall from the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to me and get me out of there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
It's kind of our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in movement.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and more robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized it as one of the 50 <unk> inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of the <unk> in downtown Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty awesome.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible, it could happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the microphone, nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited about wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we're going to find something that we feel like we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> and if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time so much dangerous time.
I went to the hard one.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
Film in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only -- a lot of fun in the beginning, something that's difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I have been <unk> in situations with horrible appearance with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that make interesting <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that looked fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and I had to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered for the name of my <unk> TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the next thing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content you could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have asked him for sure.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of <unk>
And as I said before, I became horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could have been able to <unk> it for something so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to try and make it for product -- marketing and advertising, and the <unk> and the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest <unk> film, is that all of the top at the bottom, it has a set of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
So these people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X <unk> in the title, but we're going to make sure all of the categories that we can see in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you get the highest shoe that you have.
The greatest car you've driven in "The largest car ever <unk> the best drink you've ever <unk> from "The largest <unk> movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The film of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, the whole shot at the end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money it takes to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing to a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the film is going to come out and look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think that's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for me for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I got back, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to do it.
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was, one one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to bring the product to as many people as possible, to make that as many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the apart, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
Actually, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents this picture.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or information of information, especially in the practice of <unk> being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> the President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to a reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that rare bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They took a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to give you a story, but we want to give us story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was <unk> in a lie -- and that's him looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, and I would have to take out the <unk> and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I started to <unk> suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant films and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood films, they say that the reason their movies are so successful because the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point with somebody else I can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to give you to you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> they're going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, at <unk> like it is.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at it.
Karen <unk> We are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason that this interest is.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: Okay.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool longer, better than better than -- three times more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common type of things.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like this.
Usually I carry accessories like sunglasses, and I like the crystals and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part two: <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because we <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand, Tom, but I often woke up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts relate to your thoughts and feelings to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you think about as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and they start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: Oh <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> on your personality of <unk> Isaac Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies will only occur in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them a <unk> for you, and it's nice to look at that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to get your identity, your personality of brand, what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are kind of playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You are consciously aware, like <unk>
Are you established, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're familiar -- stable, familiar, safe, safe, sacred <unk> or the Dalai Lama like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how you can now use MRI MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as for film.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no wall, there's no wall, no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts that companies are getting along in schools with online problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've interacted with more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it have gone? They did success?
Well, since the movie was sent out in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This covers just a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented to other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because of all the agencies that we talked about to their clients will not be part.
I've always believed that if you take an risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull out to the people that's pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss <unk> it's preparing for their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to us is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to do not fear of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And that said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So we put in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED organization, the Foundation <unk> a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are real control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer using an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
That really struck us and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that he didn't like our <unk> <unk> but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that one.
If not, <unk> does not do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, say, for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and put the attack code, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two bombs that are small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> armed people that obviously had the entire internal information of it.
It took all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it would break the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and high technology, let me tell them, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at were calls to the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and plants with our <unk>
And I called them and I ended up in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to make the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
So we're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number three: <unk> out in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better on it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so that there isn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been that they have been from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> were pointing to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six waterfalls and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really hated me.
There's the gray, box gray, and up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is you intercept the input values of sensors for example, of pressure sensors and sensors and provides <unk> code that still run during attack, with fake data <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up of video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is <unk> you have to open from escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they are <unk> then you can do bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither is the <unk> not the security system <unk>
That scares us.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> of uranium.
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a automobile plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms, <unk>
It will be more possible.
And if you did that, with what we <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we begin to do.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> bonds.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, hopefully <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to carry out and give you skills, or another thing that would make users of wheelchair out of wheelchair and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and it helps for example, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it into the universe and with other entities, <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on his back a load of 45 pounds, and it's getting <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries.
We decided to look at this challenge, and to create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can spend 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people -- roughly, in <unk> chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people in the spinal column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
And we also talk about the population that we've added quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other twist -- is the wheelchair ...
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago, he had a injury in the neocortical column and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that we <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches to send signals on a board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make them move on with this soft and very natural <unk>
I was a 24 24 years on the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing costs down <unk>
At a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the <unk> movement down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, "You will never come back.
That happened 19 years ago.
And so I stole it up to the last bit of hope of my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it cost rocks and even riding rocks in the hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the users of <unk> all of us all.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex, to say hello, and play is the order of day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the 21st-century festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, with chimpanzees, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large things, <unk> society is Bonobos now in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not before.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also going to put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade meat trade, and deforestation is doing that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughs, hidden trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it like the apes, <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex -- <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
By <unk> as humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game you look at the game, you see the roots of <unk> the same of the laughter, and the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how to play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case to himself, right?
Yes.
So sexual game is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it comes to you, this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes the <unk> and the same time is more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt a lot of ways -- some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman, who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos are giving us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> the peak of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which it is more <unk>
So fellow primates, we're going to accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as we make creativity and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty -- I grew fires as a captain of captain as a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are raising a highly skilled staff. You have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career with the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I met <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and she was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> --  came to the captain first to the captain and he asked her to go into the dog dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell the people that I entered a burning building to save a live alive just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise you.
It was not exactly what I expected, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen that would go to the fire firemen that at that height of the <unk> and I went into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
We take away from the house house treasures at home where, as they would expect, his treasure. received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house of home <unk> for the brave <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she watched over the other was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as voluntary fireman I witness acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or are they going to get to get it, level levels of success I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you to give you right now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have a chance to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules that they fit in.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, to a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks.
It's estimated that more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, or <unk>
It made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the particular block -- the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> brick of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they come together with magnets.
So you can't place them in a wrong way.
<unk> have an code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making greater circuits.
One blue with one green one green makes light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse module.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or slower or slower -- simply a button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to take up building ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see kids playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a fall of night, or why the door of an elevator is keeping you open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to <unk> design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took a <unk> to the Rhode Island School designers that have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper and paper and said, "Can you something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is really afraid of the dark.
For these aren't engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the reach of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small company seeks to engage with the environment will focus on it.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> can we continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you know, you know, the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
They took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild, <unk> world.
They did great <unk> worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
Meet <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it looks like if I look at a quote, but what really looks for is someone who is going to be done when you have caught up in the snow because they know it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for the help of this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a particular part of it.
It's a modest effect.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads <unk>
A responsible company of the city of <unk> <unk> looking at this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
That's why he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using using it.
And this has been <unk> <unk> organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know this isn't happening.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by normal channels it would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the time has cost 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot from the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
That is, without constraints, in a open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They have a huge frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know what we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us crazy -- the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because not <unk>
Now, a lot of people run the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
The politics didn't mean the government -- yes.
And because the government ultimately made us from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make it happen.
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the central phone center of services and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the official <unk>
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York <unk> <unk>
One day, this really happened this <unk> <unk> in my cube of crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report, saying, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to collaboration, willful volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of global platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be transferred and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected two people.
And it might be connected to the government services that you need but neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will support our values and it was in our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
Underneath this is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps us that that belongs to that that we funded as something that operates on us, that other thing, and when we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy, be sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have faced with government, it's time that we ask what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we are going to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everybody?
We can't have government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of the age of our members is 28 years old, so I <unk> -- I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to speak, everybody will talk.
You can express your opinions at any same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care a lot about how to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They're their hands to the work for program to work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, taking a fire cube <unk> a garbage cube <unk>
Of course, we were able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't make the citizen first.
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this at the practice of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard to be strong, it was power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She took a lot of <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery and <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and giving me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get me wrong.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I was going back again and if I was saying yes, I gave me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that it had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, through the room and he took me out of his hand and said, "Come <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> will tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "All right, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know it. I said, "Sure."
And then she sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do anything."
I will never forget it.
And then he said to me, "There I want you to do about three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is you always want your mother."
I said, "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never have <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said to her, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South rural rural I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of always <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> and you always do the same thing.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I went to her look at force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells us all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it for the power that it has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, it's so much <unk> as much despair, determined by these facts.
One of all three black between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore County, Washington, Baltimore Baltimore from all young people in jail are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty, if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger will believe that these are not our problems of ours.
We're <unk>
I think this is interesting.
We're looking at our work some remarkable developments so curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you know about rights.
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has lost the right when they vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights will be as elevated as it was before they <unk> the law of the right when you vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence for 13 years sentence to die in prison.
We have in this country in prison for children, without possibility to go out again.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people in the death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a sense we have helped us think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people has identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
One rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
It was not allowed to ever be able to be able to be able to fly airplanes if in every single nine that would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It is interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history -- I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted up to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, makes you <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, <unk> <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time we do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good worrying to listen to what we <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quietly and a lady said, "No way in our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we were going to run the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, and it teaches people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, things positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
And we're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But where these realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both together.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And if you think of them is, in a way, something that is inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being such rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
With innovation -- development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for the <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no sort of <unk> <unk> with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty as opposed to poverty, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered together to speak.
Occasionally, the <unk> lady called me to say to me, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you are."
I read him <unk>
And so I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in management administration administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, Mrs. <unk> got <unk> put his finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated at simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us are higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity of people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very <unk> very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> <unk> not judge for our technology, our designs, or our ability or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but by the way they treat the poor, they <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years, which have been <unk> so they were going to be treated as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can one judge turn someone into what is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was awake <unk> for God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a little poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that I was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put there that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, he had been sent to the court.
It was about two months ago, I had forgotten it.
And finally, my God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car I went on to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met the stairs when I met a black man who was the middle of the court.
And when he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He says, "It's you <unk>
And so I got confused and <unk>
And I went down in the ear, and I was looking at the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started touring her.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the police officers <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone was excited because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I came to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
They would look out the window and let me hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here.
Finally, this old black black, with a face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed himself upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who kept his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up towards justice.
That we can't be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those in the room who share this, I simply want to tell you that keep the sight on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several new opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make a <unk> effort that is going to be spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get there.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the law to get the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think is it?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war on drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population emerges dramatic in the population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply of <unk> to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've been excited about this here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for Bin Laden's death.

<unk> Death.
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- they could be the last six days or the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media media would prefer to <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, human change, water <unk> and <unk> <unk> we have <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just just got them.
Let's take what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita income has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, of transportation and communication and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was about 25 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget that.
And we continue to make a higher expectations and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, estate, refrigerators -- mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
So let's get a lot of this stuff in the technology and put it up with its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law -- and double the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason, your mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that's -- in good and bad times, in war and in peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the result of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is instead more and faster.
And on this curve, it <unk> Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> they call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize <unk> and personalized production on the whole planet, synthetic biology, the fuels the vaccine and the food, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many people saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I sought to have the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> I was going to make sure someone human faces.
"Jeopardy" is not easy play.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have a picture of absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
Is it about taking that right, and it will make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> covered with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, which was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the mass of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal as <unk>
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
So let's put this analogy into the future.
Let's think about the energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that was about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 energy <unk> every 88 minutes.
This is not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan has pointed out the Voyager towards Voyager over the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, <unk> is seawater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Is the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of water drinking water from any source <unk> saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that he will make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in that so that it will be, Coca-Cola actually implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
So this is a critical innovation for this technology that has already exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
He <unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart mobile cell with a Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, <unk> diagnostic technology now -- and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best end of it is going to come up with a health facility.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to be challenging these technologies into a mobile device that talk, and because it has <unk> you can get rid of your <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a computer medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent, and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is going to make a virus from RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the <unk> and the first place, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk> billion growing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health care.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What would you say? What would you do?
And instead of economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy in the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide us three million more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and they can act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 million?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it?
One thing I learned with the X Prize, which is that they teams were guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do things that were <unk> things that could only make large corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that you may have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at Washington University in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold protein.
The folds determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, I was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this <unk> college teachers.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than better computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three million new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades old.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea may be explained in a minute, before I will give you three examples for time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually pick fish.
And it described to one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught him a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates the <unk> of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot in the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The grass, was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a mangroves.
There were <unk> from about 20, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good time, so he was made over the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters tall.
So we have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well, it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, a pretty bad boat, called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South African China -- and, above all, at the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were coral, other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny about some <unk> remains that these coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a living company.
It wasn't yet.
And then they wanted to get them out because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to an area that they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
You want the point to start the start to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, a lot of killer whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies, kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as captain such as captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or typically not use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually also recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. It simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the nuanced and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were touched with the movie <unk> I will talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk> the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are doing <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the online video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can do famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is made viral and get infinite and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of corporate involvement and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the last summer.
They were not proposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this treatise that I would take the video to play.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> came up with new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, on a Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everyone wants to get the end of a week, the weekend in a week.   <unk> a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> Second Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, he was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday, in <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in doing a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, the process.
So, this whole community of people who shares this big inner joke starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's like that.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three million hours you've seen four million times.
So far, you saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that I woke up with the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then it was international away.
And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, a whole community came out of <unk> that made this transition from being a dumb joke to something that we all can be able to do.
Because today not only <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What could you write might have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video go up two days of video per minute, only that truly unique and unexpected the way that these things have done it.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> I found that five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we make creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of the creative communities of participation, and the wild are characteristics of a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of science.
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the current media today, but we <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time, I was friends, now that <unk>
They were <unk>
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that ever have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I got it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn itself into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a four-year four years that defies fiction, a boat became slid into the sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the bugs, the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was carrying a <unk> <unk>
We would first take it back to you first of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into every single <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start out for six hours.
But I do remember the lights out of the oil platform on the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and went to finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried to, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrant people.
Unlike the middle of the middle class -- whose existence I <unk> in <unk> had no sense of right.
The <unk> they came from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, working turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and math wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back to house."
home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered from the boat.
And my task was to be awake until the nightmares of the nightmares were to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then she studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make silicon, angry and <unk> kids -- caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student relentless with what I was aware of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in lives of <unk> repeatedly <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of college, I elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
As <unk> <unk> resident was now <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the peers and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a mother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when she was moving into the ship.
Mine had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> at <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly -- the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new <unk> and not only is it right, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is wrong, but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an unexpected optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for the people that the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup.
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some of the bright ones, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he made an stir to the <unk> and take the cause she himself, and much more <unk> made when I won.
It can't be made wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room, in <unk> when she died, one <unk> <unk>
I looked across the <unk> of the shower and I saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us are and how life we built us now we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could do that for you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave a brave <unk> the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and watch it safely do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with aircraft.
At that time, when we put the great Indian warrior Indian, I was <unk> he had a <unk> and with a <unk> on the ground, he could water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I took this idea of losing the ability of losing and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this piece of technological technology was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of hackers.
I had the feeling that your mobile phones are, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We celebrate our inspiration.
So I <unk> me to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of killing her.
It took books from the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device of narrative that can connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And this --  says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I read a character from the book.
At a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in a GPS -- that's led to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic magic of childhood to those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to break the iPad for the fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in what the adoption of the book.
Another idea I was fascinated by as a child was that a whole galaxy would come into a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of the fantasy there has always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that goes on, <unk> and guides you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and in contemporary life.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and wet book.
So we're bringing them back into a child's child history.
In a story that is current issues like climate crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> haven't gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out there, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and in an chapter, and we would have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so it creates a digital collection of pictures that then can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variations between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear about the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves in a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to do it to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to an listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or you and asked patients and family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail since we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put up the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I gave me my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that I need assistance assistance or some urgency of that style -- but it can look back.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I link to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I put up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a device.
And people are moving from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their physician, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to control the control and being captains of their own <unk> but also helping us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the cost of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks in the <unk>
Maybe even we have our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are <unk>
Also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, you have to sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> are already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what it can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to save them globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be a string services or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown in their place.
Please <unk> on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my former passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because I used the camera to use the camera on my planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that it ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me the photograph had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a unexpected.
And despite it, it keeps an <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful pictures at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say, "Huh, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in a way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real?
Are the details or the <unk>
Would you light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfect objects, which is something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a certain way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's put the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture looks realistic I think they're those ones that don't even understand the things around us in everyday lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important to do that, because otherwise something going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to go on to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed by pictures of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place to find out because you don't need to put in danger of ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made the house of the top of the summit of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think you need to have planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of food networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other that we usually see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> is something going to do.
Here's something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we have <unk> curves on scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve that you say, these are the years or a unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram -- the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
That doesn't say much.
But if you look at it, for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, you'd see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as the past <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- to look at these <unk> curves. We see that they're not still forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We put one of two things.
Or it's going to turn into a typical curve like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it might do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something happened like this.
If we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way you take the world?
Which is where the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens to be a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different and extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that you can possibly be?
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I would like to do is this time of life on Earth.
I think this picture has a sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals coming around them.
If you look at the way that chemicals were organized, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there's theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was a little bit of oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate material from the outside and the drops grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were more <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a chemical prescription of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every single <unk> it was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops of them in some way will become better at the time to incorporate chemicals down, and more chemists -- more chemists and <unk>
They usually lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry, very simple, but things are <unk> interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I'm trying to hide to the airport people from the airport.
But <unk> took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we usually use to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card. I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it on a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another great step happened in which things are very different, and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin, and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that are forming communities that were together in a way, and established a <unk>
And so we <unk> or <unk> -- or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community are getting more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities -- communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and have more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the tools that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures to understand and understand the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat a certain fruit because I knew bad and sick last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of the fruits of individuals who ate that fruits of the fruits of individuals who ate that fruits of the fruits of individuals who ate that fruits of the fruits of individuals
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormous accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention of it.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea that I think about the head.
I'm sitting here doing a little bit of <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague idea, and <unk> in your heads that have some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we turn it into sound, in sound footage, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform abstractions.
We now go through similar periods of similar periods of organisms that are <unk> our methods of record is <unk> and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and capable of evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few stages, and the brain took a few hundred million years old.
New language, and so they took less than one million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the more it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to focus on the conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine in the machine that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and you take those that are more attached to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They took those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best ones to take the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children will take the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of material programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's start again.
So let's get some mutations in it.
And it tries again and tries to bring it back to another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to show them to see how they work.
They're brown programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I was once on a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make a very different design process.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering produces as well.
However, we don't understand the whole options that are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I got out of it.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my fake fake, in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end of the World Wide World
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that 300.
That means the bat bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who tries to deal with the first base, not coming to time, and the second level will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what you call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> <unk>
<unk> like General Ted Williams, the last player.
Now I put this into my world in medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they belong to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a dear person has two <unk> <unk> and your family doctor took it to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> <unk>
But do you know something?
She's actually getting a lot better.
And the hits and the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you to ask:
What you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
And <unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is send them to the world, and I include the <unk> of being perfect.
What would ever, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Sachs studied until a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the residence of nurses from the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis and frequent <unk> and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the diagnostic diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the school school with the impression that if you put it all, then it would know everything, or as possible to close to everything, because so I got rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the <unk> lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was given to the service of <unk>
And when I applied it to a cardiologist to talk to a cardiologist that I was looking at that patient.
And he was reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which sent me heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood ahead, the blood goes into our lungs, the blood is filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
And I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about.
I gave you aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure in their heart.
I gave him the water pills so that he could eliminate liquid it.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I really made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to have <unk> data.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who was doing constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner that said, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was until I asked the nurse who <unk> the <unk> lady who is okay with his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed up the tall, and the ambulance alongside the ambulance took her to her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to go back to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So at that time I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I didn't do anything I don't know.
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there was another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lunch lady before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most of the doctors in emergency <unk>
Other specialists are afraid of them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the surgical patients.
The three words are: Does that remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour that I had come home, after I gave him the high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought them in emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I barely breathed and it was blue.
The emergency investment staff will take all their resources.
They gave you medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course it was clear to me that never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And to the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. mother and grandmother.
They are never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks after, I was excited about it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat in by just that healthy shame because you can't get rid of your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad in it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that did.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the stuff out and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept leaving those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on a day <unk> he opened the sky and finally the sun came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I gave you to the efforts to be perfect to do not make any more mistakes, I would make up those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it would happen.
Two years later, I was in the emergency department in a community hospital in a northern hospital in Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with an pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he walked to the door kept on the door, he kept on his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> my head asked to talk to me in his office.
And he gave the three words: Does that remember you?
Do you remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially fatal condition.
You can put it in Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, I don't know.
You got antibiotics on the way, and they recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn -- not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it would be put up to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
He took an X-ray of your kidneys but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague who was checking the patient to the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand quadrant, I called the surgeon.
Both they were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I was passionate about -- I was shocked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I walked into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard about failure, I'll talk about failure, and after failure?
And of course, at a party you'll hear about errors in other doctors, but you're not going to hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital -- my wrong, believe that I would have a hard time to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that not. those who can't sleep, and those who yes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal study of bad medical and errors in order to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto, "Star <unk> Black <unk> white, Black <unk> <unk> white, Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen in every single day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system in which the infections are getting more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, I die 24 thousand Canadian errors in the world.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get away from it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow them to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with an chest pain comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath in <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we moved, and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, don't get no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their wildest cases.
In my <unk> <unk> white, Art <unk> is a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk>
And their students would get <unk> <unk> your head and <unk> <unk> and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, they know the human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They hate their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They would make mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support and support for everybody to be saved.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes from time to time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor <unk>
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey of over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an average American, are about 70 to a day.
Not long ago, in a research they went for a week to a group of companies of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> by these executives and the time that we were trying to make things related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs.
So obviously, every job in a whole lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we figure out how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choose to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
So in the other way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for favor of a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this at the very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated at least at the time.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water -- and this was when we take water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf on the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists which came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
He took a place to <unk> right to the store.
We put it out there -- six <unk> or 24 tastes different and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here's the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when there were 24, only three percent of us were going to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found a six. If they were six.
Well, we decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably get rid of -- it's less good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> choice is affecting us very <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even when we don't get away from it.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> funds available for retirement savings plans for retirement, the <unk> <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding had less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that are <unk> the rate of participation was from 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about <unk> the rate of participation descended into the 50th 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when you have more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the number of options, the more people are going to be excited about avoiding stocks or investment.
As much as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts at the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences of offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision, even when it comes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health care.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> although objectively it going to be better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've got, in one way or another, in different research, so they can use in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, less than today, less than today, less than today.
People always feel like when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to be able to be able to get rid of odd options, <unk> there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation called <unk> <unk> just eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that were less than <unk> they increased <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower ones.
You know that today's supermarkets -- on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store are about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to manage the best options is a grant from David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a life fund of life.
People who want to choose, are giving them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how <unk>
These are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This is before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday on vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give yourself if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really brought to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first <unk> that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second set of technique to manage the problem of the choices <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent more than 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use it is using a while.
Because it doesn't seem real.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more of it.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we were looking at exactly how we did a little <unk>
What we have added was we appeal to the staff who would think about the positive things that they would put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their accounts for <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can manage more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to anyone -- not that <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
Am I supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than what we think about if we just put it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity of incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a nice decision that you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that lets <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offering each one.
<unk> out of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors -- just four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four <unk> in 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you get the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that are going from a lot of choices to ages, <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways that you make it for choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminate alternatives <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can run more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about the <unk>
And the more careful how we be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
And in the years we went in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it in front of the government.
I had to record a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a <unk> with the wrong message that you could track the footprint.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that we can do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color laser from any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
So this is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put their attacks into their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from New York City in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, enormous amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy it on a <unk> computer.
The secret service in the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of bombers in importance is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, which motivate you the protests, they motivate them the opinions, they motivate you laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the attacks online.
Those are the top three main pressing criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United States and the United States that we <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from viewers of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They gave the security from the site and make a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of a attack from these?
<unk> is an effective authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Why does the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that you have a foreign authority foreign authority.
And they were going on the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened to the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters who were <unk> the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder, called <unk>
And within that folder, there was notes of a company based on Germany that had been sold to the Egyptian government who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide them tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond.
<unk> connection to the Internet.
And even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument does not make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we will spend today, will be forever.
It will be <unk> in any future government, in an administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my father, at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi is not fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and the boxes, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for us, and that's why we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People are dying of the warriors that protect our community and livestock and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A kid in my community, in the age of nine to the age of nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually this didn't happen to me, because even helping the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't have <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to cheat the lions so they believed that I was close to <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came up the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So I jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come in.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn the lights out.
And this is a little glass lamp, a <unk>
It will make it all.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity into the little box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to the problems with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and I asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea also is used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators like dentists, <unk> and it's also used to get elephants from farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds, and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that I don't have, and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in meadows of the <unk> <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see they could fly, and he said to me that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting a story is to hear a story like you.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions in the electric character.
What's the next to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electrical CA: A little bit near <unk>
<unk> I know that you're already invented electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: I just got it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: Al <unk>
We're going to <unk> every single step that I <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we moved all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> history, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister.
He said, "When we <unk> this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten the two weeks now.
We are <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A homeless woman was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> them because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine went to North Korea in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more rare the power cuts -- all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made of reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was arrested at the police.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and I got a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and ask the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China, looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight as hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and finding work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
This is why, after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to risk the South Korea
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a challenge much more than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride with me.
Although I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to bring it into my new life, I got an alarming call.
North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as a result, my family was going to be moved to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught up several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked them to all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I went on and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border illegally.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison in the South Korean <unk>
I went and came up between the immigration office and the police station, desperately tried to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to other North Koreans and take them from prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why did I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get it to the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and support from the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to get his freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in English, practical language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we sent information and money that is helping us change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans, around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> Center for <unk> food, fast food, <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, let's change the name of South Central Center to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles and South Los Angeles as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles in Los Angeles --  <unk> -- fast food, fast food.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Los Angeles -- the home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that places of food to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles State Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I'm going to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of your house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as cars <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And I just got tired of driving out 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet x three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it out.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to do, because this is my responsibility and I have to make it out."
So it was like I decided to continue it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do is we are kind of a <unk> group made out of gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then somebody will be <unk>
The city came up to me, and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> by saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> was made out of the <unk>
And I said, "Come on, "Come on it?
An order for planting food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so he was like, "Okay, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even meant to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more broken land.
It has <unk> <unk>
That's the equivalent of 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars from it.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, grow your own food.
Do your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I was interested in being part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture, my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if they let be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing this is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the <unk> and provocative act.
Also, you get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and they were in my garden, went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt the shame of seeing people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people are going to rob your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to <unk> her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
These guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed the changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a <unk> like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in plan.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and your body, eat blind what they put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are stuck. I see pictures of color that are on this way designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never change it.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy.
I don't care about me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy and the pride and the honor of cultivating their own food, by opening our farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Did you take them to take your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me -- I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very <unk> road.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you can do.
And especially if you're going on on your bicycle and these cars go away, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, you'd want a quiet road on the ground.
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can go through it, so all water water flows down the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you will not get water to water anymore.
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road on the surface of the surface is <unk>
First, a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and then I -- well, I won't do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk>
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
This is <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you <unk> you will be <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel, from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool from steel into little pieces and we can mix those little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool and steel on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at it.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample coming out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to be <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this stuff.
So that's what we did in there, you see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take lots of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, we put them on them, then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether it worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how to be able to play the repair of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to news News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on her face that it was unusual at those times, because the news usually <unk>
The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what I would do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban broke out of Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were two to be able to do it.
Every day, we had a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books on market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead of when the school was <unk> a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, to go to school and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home to girls and girls from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there was moments that I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house off for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still want not to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He didn't just get away from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm driving around the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first one and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As a <unk> it's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from her way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told her that if she kept sending his daughter to school, they would come back.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter by his old child and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there's a dad who recognized the value of his daughter, and he sees that successful success their own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school tell me remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I'm afraid that these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day, the girls of <unk> gave me <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since broke the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of massive <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East to west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and some losses in about 50,000 years, we were able to release our country and <unk> to <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, <unk> <unk> a transition transition and <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the autonomy of the woman and for our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which are <unk> of selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was expanding and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> ancient <unk> and graves <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> violation of human rights -- and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made a <unk> mindset -- and it's become away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to engage with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, chose to worse, make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the feminine values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than it needed the election, and that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the heightened representation of the women's more than it would need the representation and we would need to use it.
We need to stop acting as an elephant agents and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also put it in practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion in place of exclusion.
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to get the end of peace to peace.
Because peace has a alchemy which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way to make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity of the men and women who all tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And so, like the uterus covers the <unk> which grows in, the divine matrix of the compassion <unk> all of existence.
And then you say, "My <unk> for all the things."
This is how "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
It will all be given to you, the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
So I'm here today to talk to you about a ridiculous question, which has a equally equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that all make the usual <unk> Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor am I a social worker, no training in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had had had been at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first American <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my alma alma soul <unk> my head with a <unk> loaded with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> from the <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies of <unk> <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm about 20 years away with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a black <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the <unk> all the religions, every income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only going on in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or saying otherwise, in the families, the last place we want or expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going to be with a man who would stick it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence that the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in the United States are killed every year by partners, <unk> and Palestinian husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and working in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field of the field.
He had a little bit of <unk> big <unk> and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, which was doing a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done before.
And that's why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I left my work and <unk> and I went back from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a physical trap financial and psychological psychological trap ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they are supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe and bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another guy he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma of a small game.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns actually were a message for me and, although I had never raised me my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack on <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend from my mother and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved him and he also wanted to me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just became very <unk> by the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I was never more to hurt.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that they <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon was <unk> by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> went on to run one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So I actually had a great company.
So to go back to my question: Why did I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was using me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man who was the only person in the world that could help us help to deal with their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just not <unk>
Why don't you <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question than people do, because to us, we know the victims, we know something that normally you know, you are incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the private violence in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim is finally in the end of the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent bullying even after the <unk> has gone back to married, and it has gone back to the financial resources of financial resources, and it manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually obliged for judges to spend their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to convince him because of a last <unk> and he dropped my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world: the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family and family unknown, and I'm here today because everybody has helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people it is a way to say, <unk> is theirs to <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened and that they would make their lives joyful and joyful lives like <unk> handcuffs, lives completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What's going to be going back to have never more, possibly is a gun that pointed to my head in the hands of someone who says she will.
Right now, the same thing you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were being <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my <unk> particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> tend only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We need victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the <unk> talking about it with your children, your coworkers of work, their friends and family.
They put their vision for survivors as fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
You know, <unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
And together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to work on now, but to find them on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And he was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would put my back back and he <unk> his kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, "A <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also been associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage that I've known to take for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now exhibit <unk> and maybe there's some of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> -- there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we would take them to know how much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always do is: Can it be model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then what would tell you about one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, I want to be model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
Now to say that you want to be model is to say you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike surgery, I can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've seen your studies, and you have a show and some works and your backs, no matter what you're going to do, is to say, if you want to be President of the United States, but you take your copy <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This was my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in the V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a bunch of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and ever use, except the <unk> but the privileges I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course, and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
And so I'm going to tell you about these privileges because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what no matter what they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were par and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's how many times my <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of 13 percent of the United States they don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that they expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we got it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing power to work with creative and ingenious creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever say you are asking -- with some more thin legs and the <unk> hair to be happier.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brighter hair and clothes -- but probably the <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that will retain from this talk, I hope that everybody gets more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to me who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimal care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them <unk>
My story begins when, in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture by holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York at a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to get out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is that universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk> the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that it was a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in October week and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reached new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spent together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it became dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the tent that was <unk> of small in the previous stage.
And I told me what I felt at five years of foot in that same place.
They assumed that he remembered his heart line by force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage everyone to come up in the picture, and I didn't go back to someone and ask him, and he gets a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group of birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs, and the silly <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughter, applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They hardly are <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> get better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World <unk> which are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World War -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why should the <unk> be important? First of all, provide vital ecological services.
They are our <unk>
<unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria helping to absorb anthrax that not being used by them would spread and cause huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the <unk> of the sacrifice and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United Nations and under Egypt.
In the mythology of Hindu mythology was the <unk> god and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, we are doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead dead, or the wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are in extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are the victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered endangered list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because the prey of livestock consumption has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge time bomb for <unk> The number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Africa, there's a horrible trade trade, to serve the <unk> and the market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're doing these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a problem locally is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell you to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their kids, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because they saw it <unk> no energy <unk> in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all we played the <unk>
Our first project, the one that inspired my first book, <unk> of <unk> was a project where I mean, I decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we get with seeds that are <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't going to be <unk>  We were amazed that the local <unk> in such fertile fertile hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we would not make anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> in time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato sauce would grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to them, "Look how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only for the Italians were going to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they were doing the pommies, and they were doing what the people were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  -- to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root -- <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said about everything economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you ever get to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you?
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We came up in a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And so we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, I will tell you, but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you about a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been identified.
So planning has this blind.
The smartest people of their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor who gets involved with you at your house, at the table of their kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city.
I was doing a PhD at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so I got <unk>  So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most intense business undergraduate academic books, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you to <unk> privacy, it has to be great to the <unk> and then they will look at a mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what you show you most of you guys have <unk>
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils not renewable <unk> and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that I read in a magazine magazine makes many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> a bunch of people came together, and I think about what would happen to New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already used by <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> New York City.
So what happens? For the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then I just will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing cake, and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
And we've looked at the 100 companies icon of the religious world, <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: One was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment in small business <unk> in coffee bars on bars on bars next to their dedicated dedicated people who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who is talking about this <unk> somebody who is going to ask you, what does it take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Let's look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't switch very much knowledge despite the share of the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors to their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hope to empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs to be able to reflect on our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always stops the music.  There is a <unk> show in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful DNA of the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned property properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and unexpected it.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this made me deep gratitude for the time of life.
It gave him clarity to the significant things about my current life.
But I was able to keep this look in my daily lives.
I think it's easy to be able to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> he stopped <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I died, I want to be judged by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
"Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
"Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I die I want to spend one time more."
"Before she died, I want to go to the <unk>
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. This is about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving up the reflection and the <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit that they have now been used in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions that is increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very delicate and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we become more power.
And if you think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community and more media to share hopes, fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 and very <unk>
It doesn't speak, but it brings better joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
Does it share <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to the religious differences and notice about this: Never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell you the words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel it's 16 years old. It's very hot.
It makes the <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, getting pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, if you didn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing that were <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, out there that <unk> it is so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, is going to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster in the world, there's no cause no cure for us.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
So let's get a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking around the room and eating anything that had <unk>
As I was growing up, it gets more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child that saw the world without <unk> a human who had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I would not want to change for normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and for you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and, frankly, search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher from communications, who gave a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of the truth of these students with their great minds, their great books and their big unknown words and <unk>
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what he was doing, must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt so I felt when I had these conversations with students surprised me, the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and care of health, and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists as scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
I think, why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us to just tell us that study <unk> but study <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, caring for <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them wrong.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do <unk> The bullets are killed by killed, and they put their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the area of our brain and we will be <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows than the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower of <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the <unk> English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that I defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for an audience in public care, no matter -- and that, when he won, it gets it for the mere use of a monumental monumental monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words to quote the exact words that were told by the camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
I read him in the Tower of London and he was thrown out, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and eventually he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's false.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about being tested with it.
And not even that was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given record.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of getting tired of it, because this debate was happening for three weeks.
And I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the Kansas House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call him King if they did not give it to him or her <unk>
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> than it came to you.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was no longer -- but it was only meant by <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Wow, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to be serious with such a ridiculous and insignificant title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to follow there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> that we keep going to move for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this I want to tell you, is that the President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, is the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness back then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I think that I'd like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, reality changes a lot more the words that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light -- she holds my head up with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole in that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, who lost control and fell <unk> in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole by risking their lives without paying a reward, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never will. Because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is done to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not about <unk>
When we end up talking to me I felt very sad, I mean, I was honestly about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that currently there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave slave slaves for the whole thing.
150 years ago, the cost of a Jewish slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk>
But today, you can enslave entire families for generations per <unk> tax <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profit from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education promises and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under violence threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods that are produced by slaves are value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
And this strange show and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 percent, men, women, children, in fact, entire families put together in a heavy <unk> <unk> brick in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the blast <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee eating, and there was no coffee to drink, and the severe <unk> made you just pee out of a lot of <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot in touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
Back on the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't citizen in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system by his release and he trusted what they would do.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart attack.
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> stones for miles per <unk> terrain until they were expected to down.
Those big <unk> were stronger than the children charge their heads and the children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of nothing."
It's hard to witness something so much.
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to do with it.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When we hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness -- that would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I <unk> women who had been previously <unk> <unk>
I was brought up by some steps that were going to take me into this dirty basement of <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local to prostitution <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and dirty identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer from sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a sharp fear of fear and in that moment, barely could imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs so that I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows very big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we played a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual <unk> is going around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in the restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that we often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, and the blue <unk> and the blue <unk> of their children.
We were going to put together in these big barrels and we drip silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My <unk> told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they were told.
We still hope, though, we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we came up, I went to take a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two younger siblings -- some more young kids, it makes sense, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families who were <unk> they have forced to work a lot in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was a topic that his little canoe little <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> to often catch networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it comes to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> the <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone else decided to make a difference in your life?
They went through a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
It asked us to take it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path near and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started <unk> we took the <unk> off the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures about my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer camp and they were all full of enslaved.
A lot of women had children attached to their backs and as long as they were looking at gold gold, <unk> <unk>
<unk> used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they went out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The pits have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags of rock that then will be attached to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold.
In first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the bottom, we see a lot less fortunate and also to children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up as this victim of T.B. and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, I was able to inherit the debt of the uncle that force him to be slave in mines.
When I met her, he had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is the product of an accident in the <unk> that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, yet, to that, is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being released and educated with local activists from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and we will do everything in order to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult <unk> <unk> like slavery.
These images are not talking about, people are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happened to me I don't think about these many beautiful people who have had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turned to a fire and that fire will light up on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this applied mathematics -- and there's a particular problem for whom we <unk> we are like the management loss.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later.
But the <unk> demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a very early <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic element.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous little ballet <unk>
In the last few years, we've been making a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if we actually have a cure will be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never have been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. How about if patients could get the exam to <unk>
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to think about as a kind of conventional form for a try, you see, in a sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sound to talk to you -- we can imagine as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes have that <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think the time it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as the Parkinson's and the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affecting the <unk>
At the bottom of the bottom of you can see a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are accurate. Well, but also tests of <unk> are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very minimum and we all know what happens.
When something comes down to a cost of cost, it appears at mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to help address.
We can reduce our patients.
I wouldn't do lack to go to the clinic for the <unk> <unk>
<unk> monitoring <unk> we could get goals.
We could make it <unk> massive amounts of cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or Parkinson's disease, can call it low price and leaving <unk> and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have no disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the <unk> the confusion of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to have <unk> has done fantastic work and now has been shown to work on mobile mobile phone as well, what we <unk> the project, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are gray.
We would go into the dark, in the dark rooms, and we usually avoid sunlight.
We make the models thin even more <unk> the perfect skin is still more <unk> we do the impossible, and we have <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a true taste of true and photography.
On March 11 of March in 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> -- there were <unk> -- he was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level took over 24 feet tall and over three miles into the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take out of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> took up the slime and left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We loved it, and we loved it.
In weeks, both volunteer people like the neighbors were similar to the same thing.
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and they take them to different places of villages around us for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center.
It helped us clean the bathrooms -- huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> would pick up the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day would be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression of speech beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them still were in the lab about the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started to tweak the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get rid of a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got a little bit more photos, and they got more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, he had 150 people who were <unk> of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we gave us to <unk> a village neighbor to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
So the time we put in <unk> it's a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could take an hour for an hour. I could <unk>
It could <unk> months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas that the areas and detail that the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these <unk> photos in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all of it along with oil, all of it next to the time of the time, continue to <unk> that by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't tinker with the photo unless it was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk> by hand.
We have the guide to a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said once, the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had kind of kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> it itself but stopped realizing it was even more.
It also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face, they wouldn't have been able to <unk> we were able to collect the images in a single picture and tinker the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures shared some of their story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble far away from where he used to be his house, but their colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her small children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took him a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her her photos his son was at least 14 years old.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, look at something that I could remember from the past day in March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there, hundreds of them helped us clean up to clean hand over <unk> pictures -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 families by hundreds of <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> a thousand in teams and materials -- most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures.
A picture is a picture of someone or something, a relationship, a loved one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we were going to do, but the first thing we were going to look for.
This is the project of restore little pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you get back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to give them something, using their talent for something that are not thin models of perfect skin.
To finish up this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I went back, I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to be awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, really and challenging the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and put it into a <unk> or it is, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> set of photons and just a millimeter millimeter millimeter wide.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common shot.
If we take that bullet and this set of photons and we shoot it into this bottle, how do they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light light.
Coca-Cola did not take this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a pair of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that film?
A week? Actually, a week?
It would be a very boring film -- a bullet <unk>
And how about proving nature <unk>
You can see the waves that fall from the table, and the tomato wall and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes look a full <unk>
But if you look at this one more and more <unk> you'll notice that, as the light <unk> of the <unk> you still have <unk>
Why? Because the tomato light is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at low exposure, it comes into a very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so we can just get some light.
You know, <unk> that <unk> that <unk> millions of times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we take these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of the future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You want to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy <unk> and the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to what a distance.
By designing a laser can record a picture at <unk> that, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we go together, and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object that is <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to build collisions with what's around the curve, around the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected in open windows.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body <unk> <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is pretty difficult, so this is actually an order to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new pattern of visualization to address the problems of screening in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself, was a scientist, turned science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> of data that we collected each time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see them.
So creating a new form of computational photograph with slow motion and color code.
And look at those ripples Remember, the time between each of those waves is only about <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have would have loved to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
We get the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and you give individual freedom.
With a cell phone can give you a <unk> in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and then make it famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. So imagine if all of these people who are <unk> that you would look for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, your Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk to you today about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 hundred pieces of information.
crude raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. came up with a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This board says that every European telephone company, every single Internet monopoly on Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends <unk>
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and until two years, in his telephone company or his Internet website.
And all over Europe and people laughed and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers, and the Internet providers, all of this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk>
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information on us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who would please tell me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I came back to ask them, and I didn't have a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give this information.
At the end, I have a deal.
They took the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people, 30 information lines.
I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they're called each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicates with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither does the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not about fashion.
When you go home, you get to the representative of the fact that because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that are a way to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why we spread all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one would neglect the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's only about accidents, like which happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> Christmas, are in the commercial mall, drive in a parking circles, and what do you see?
16 places for disabled places.
And think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian <unk> Muslim woman, alive and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from "Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial history.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also going, and if I didn't know the top note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was a dollar a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the Korean kindergarten walked as a boxer champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
The people I grew up with had no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that they died of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that he had enough fat to live three months without eat, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going to get back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I drank warm cups on the back, I was sitting on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can hide on the head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital
I went to university by <unk> <unk> and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all the smartest tasks of the least <unk> I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene from the zoo of glass -- my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow at Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, I finally got it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running back to the principal of the theater, crying as if somebody had killed my cat, asking why and she told me that because they thought it could not make the stunt stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and they gave an actor without cerebral palsy,
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled people.
When I went back home, and my first tour tour, was as extra in a <unk>
My dream was true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that directors of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
They only get to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took up <unk> famous from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he was at high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find them really fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media media and once remind directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire <unk> with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate school, I went to a graduate school, and I sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the principal and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the desk of the speaker to not get out of walking over the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like I was in my full-time <unk> and hit my chair.
A lot of fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are said that kids are <unk> but they never had a little bit of a little girl or a little bit older than that.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would see clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We really should be praying for her."
One guy suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do it, then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
The disabled are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
Doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive pictures, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was looking at the big state of New Jersey state in 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee kids a tiny fraction of what my parents were going to me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I spend this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small village.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The <unk> <unk> to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there is no jobs, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day is a guy who offers him to take it back to dinner, and then <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
You show a young guy.
Finally home.
It begins a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> an organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he took him from what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity of jobs, of jobs, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be American history.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
The 70 percent don't work, not to go to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in that hospital and I was going to have to think of it in my hospital thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few young leaders in a business school.
They took about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
And I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate college university a few frustrated, frustrated, was the perfect <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war has destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It began <unk> turned to local residents who were usually couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story do differently?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's <unk> and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years ago, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from the overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of them who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working on the creation of the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business for local problems.
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance for <unk> in developing their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need to support the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for the urban <unk>
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park <unk> that's how it calls it, when it is created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: I will become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> that <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains called an <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we were going to think about, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake, when I discovered something nasty.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square meters with an apple hearts -- you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought it was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where we did the <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our junk -- by 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
So what do you feel using the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
And I was traveling on the trucks and I walked through her pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in my trucks. I am <unk>
And they <unk> the mechanical mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you are rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of getting used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies continue to get their bodies to take on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Scientific Rights <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> most dangerous in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so that the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And the trash is also full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also a way of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And that is also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I think that <unk> <unk> are the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a very efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> their container and its dangers inherent in the very real ways.
The disease we had to be used for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for the new so that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointed out its relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed as a daily rate.
I mean just the speed that used to be used at the time we get used at <unk>
We usually don't get rid of us, and we don't get <unk> or we took our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bag of water.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that it takes for it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the waste collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you are."
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001 I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little kid on the street, and he went down the stairs, and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and simply <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste collection and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should embrace and have to realize all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about trash represent three percent of the entire nation.
It's a remarkable statistic
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects to example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought about was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the cladding with crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it comes from a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what does not have anything to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a bad place for a rich place in culture and traditions.
On our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted with the old market that is this structure of the open air where thousands of people are going and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, in many stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the city, which is located in a very much growth zone of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries in the building.
And this spreads out of an <unk> <unk> which creates an open space in the building that was absorbed by its own form, from the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the input to the air, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of dresses on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that will leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developer because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was a lot more profitable than the mall because in the end of the world there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was dramatically more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it doesn't need to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where the electricity takes almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big project, the biggest one I designed, I needed not to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> -- a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen 12 percent power doors connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was we expand the streets there, creating 12 basic blocks similar and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of interconnected and interconnected lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell cell, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's give you a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density at higher levels and lower density at the bottom plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like <unk> to the community that was occupied by building it.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and make activities such as a <unk> run in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives, changes communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the way out of the middle of the school, I was a little afternoon and stood up in the kitchen bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt and I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher.
And then, I did.
I put the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit like this.
And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my others had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> they will <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put all of these rows from <unk> and I just got a row to me, just because I was there.
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never care about it.
It's that it was all very obvious to it.
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I'm going to tell you, the reason I was bothered by the reason that this little <unk> was so good for <unk>
And the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one by the number one <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if it weren't <unk> <unk> there would be literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> not <unk> and a <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> that they have all of them.
This year is being 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we could have.
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the <unk> of cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details about to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all novelists like <unk> and that's something that I understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm really cool that we <unk> it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private volume.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the large amounts of hair bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links well the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> of soon listening behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are seeking knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us experience, it causes us a much deeper range of feelings and vital than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look with so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was used with the idea that his wife would be asked.
And Freud says that there was something bizarre on that man, who didn't get into what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that made his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
So novels are very good at this.
The novels really very well how <unk> are doing it with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, the more we become fantasy than fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to do violent acts or illegal acts of it.
<unk> are helping us to behave in very <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself for eight years -- I get it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account at Facebook since that that was sent messages to that was <unk> horrifying itself, for one year.
For one year a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big even <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a novel, of Patricia Schroeder
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who tries to do the <unk> who are <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get out of your being and <unk> of what once <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in terms of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had any favorite <unk> <unk> <unk> the face of rat <unk> <unk> that needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but they need it to be <unk> and it would be <unk> in the each one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six -- once you came in, you know, <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of it.
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to give you your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history, and I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated like a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so <unk>
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the plans of <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
Science used to the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet name is <unk> the scary thing, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> cotton module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone alone, but their presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a <unk> collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a bunch of people and asked about 20,000 and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities in government.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on its surface, of which led after Armstrong death, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask why <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why are I climbing the <unk> mountain.
So 35 years ago, why would you fly over the <unk>
Why is Rice against <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> the Apollo <unk> was not just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was to wonder about the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the moon came up in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and it was eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we could not go faster than a horse, or a ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 <unk> flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism bias about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure the global population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the escape tube tube from the rocket Saturn V.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear that all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have told us and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> and social media, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created by least ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years in which they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are all the <unk> specifically, the incentives that the risk venture venture venture capitalist.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment caused to be <unk> creation of ideas by funding for problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its high point without caring for the risk, they preferred a little investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been struggling to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and which we need to be in the long term. They have no longer invested in development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any affordable value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we were to go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that would be popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption is from renewable energy sources like solar power, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative sources of energy alternatives that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in today's political climate that we'll see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technology, they turn out not to be.
We know for long time that famines are a result of failure.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis to affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and 50 food, but there will be famines while there are bad governments.
And finally, the big problems sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was declared war in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some resistant resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found a lot of effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need to have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to address the problem: institutions must support <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, is that it works with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there is no science science mythology like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decline in trust, it's a very large belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should be able to regain confidence.
I think the goal of the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that it may have dropped into some activities or institutions that could have increased in others.
I don't have the clear.
But I can go through opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, primarily journalists and politicians, keep inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable 20 years ago they are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizens of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence that's enough?
What <unk> opinion are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes that people do when you do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably ask for the question, "What do they what?"
And that would be a very fair answer.
And you could say, when you said, "Well, when you said, "Well, I trust you guys, but in some other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in the form of <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain type of <unk> and a person or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher in elementary school I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in the most <unk> way.
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the true standard of real trust, because they're trying to get the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that goal that I <unk>
I would be able to get more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were holding their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. Madoff, which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yes, it says, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters to the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we're going to have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible for them to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the email because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do things -- but I see that they would take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible and extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't heard me.
But that's what we're very excited about, right before confidence.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems from accountability for all sorts of professional institutions, officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task to judge trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> I'm going to look at <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will recognize that the system of accountability that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence for <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may all know that you know similar examples.
Let's get all of that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be worthy of trust and <unk> to people that we are safe and if we try to determine whether other people, officials are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> what doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
They went to the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is signature because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't support the whole of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to have <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That makes it every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks on it says that I can get them out without giving different people.
I take them and get it back and get the money away from the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very difficult for <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more than one point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how it would happen.
I first created this tool that would be <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can give their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break down.
But the two hands are still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the Computer <unk> division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
And they took a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, reach inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that goes down from every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things for the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical pixel in the world.
This magnet, <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> to reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and distance and the famous takes from Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality of the time that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating about changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to support our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After survive the Copernican Revolution believed firmly that there was just an educational path towards <unk> a safe and <unk> job.
No matter whether I would love or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese architecture.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I would even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But anyone else will give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years, I knew it was already too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
I think that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was all the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not a convenience. <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it would be.
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
So let's make a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map I thought it was out of place because this is what the students in China should learn.
I had ever occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in everyday life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that Chinese <unk> is literally <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I will not feel like I feel like I feel like that.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that life is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
And Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch in my office and he took out the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class partner had a <unk> like first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move the head while they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home after that, you have kids later, until death goes after.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> to press Alex talking about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under your category, <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, it doesn't, but maybe you go back with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk> <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to age without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're unbelievable.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that shape their life will have gone for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, you don't panic to panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are going out with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it's <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to bring them on their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time line of adulthood.
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of <unk>
The journalists -- <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you hit a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing about nothing.
And then every single day, <unk> intelligent <unk> like you or your children and kids come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not at all.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be well."
But then it starts going to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better report the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going to sound something like this: "My dating.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, the music crashed and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but you don't get rid of the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the 30s, and so many of you start a career, choosing a city, pick a couple, and have two children in a long time of time much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful doing everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you <unk> What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said she would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so that I spent the last years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a few very difficult <unk> her earlier life was even more difficult.
We were often in our <unk> but then he would wake up with her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for nearly the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and had spent all the morning <unk> with his many relationships, but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words in case of <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if you give me up.
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the previous decade of Emma go ahead.
So, over the next few weeks, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma which was <unk> from that identity crisis, and an identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity produces an identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to do.
I'm not <unk> the exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds of who you know what they know about, how do you think about it, how they talk and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will come out almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak links from friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs that are created never complained, then, knowing the head of your neighbor is how to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon would go back to her family when she has a couple and there is his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit on than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or tell you, now when everyone on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or kill time with whoever you <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the quarter of the quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
And this weak bond was helped to get a work there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave a boyfriend with which I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married one man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to send me a letter to me saying, "Now the spaces of emergency workers are not sufficiently <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out to some place in the West.
Just before <unk> a slight match in its trajectory that makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good season, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's the privilege that I have the privilege of telling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your own identity, get your links -- you get your links <unk>
They don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job on management management for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach students mathematics to <unk> <unk> public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, you test tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When I work back, I would go back grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance did not have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids weren't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
But what if you're going to be successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to learn a rapid and that easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the world's <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids are going to be possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking questions, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, emerged one feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked the thousands of high school students who made my guts to determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the kids who were more determination had more likely to graduate, even when we put them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety that they felt when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development will determination on children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know. What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related or is even related to the talent measures talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was passionate about this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quick learning might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each character from every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster, simple way.
A Chinese academic hero, 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy
The first 200 will allow us to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read signals of traffic menus <unk> from restaurants, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the paper.
We will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as being possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was screaming like <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> gates on the old West.
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are <unk> three are a crowd.
If one person stretch out your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big thing.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You take a table under the tree, we have the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two like together, it becomes very hot.
Three things together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
You take the sun and the moon up together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Did you have someone at home?
This person is leaving hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, bear care is <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters built other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as learning a Chinese <unk>
So after I met the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin, created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies, beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, saw the magician of Oz combined.
The movie challenged his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a nice excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand to me.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a sort of a industrial complex of a child in a child of a child fantasy program.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose <unk> a metal guy, and a kid <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I believe that if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Would you make magical shoes to defeat the armies were made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The one thing of the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
Within three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  And so slid in the room and was struck as a leg with her <unk> her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
So I would feel that Luke would have an army to <unk> the government?
I put this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy the film?
It's doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with <unk> right? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there that much <unk> capital force in movies for our kids, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give you the proper framework that I would have served to navigate by the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why keep standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
movies are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a suit of <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, but they, boys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real, and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to appear on classic after a classic each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still hasn't been rooted in it, and maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the mid 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there's more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to leave the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point of the film?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid you like it?  All right?  All right?  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success from <unk> a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies -- how many of them believe that they have shared protagonists
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage than the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was saying, right?
In the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually assaults ever in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't believe that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music videos or pornography, are very <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do not achieve <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat on <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of race man is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character from "Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle and struggle and even more stories where he looked at their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine -- I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand covered and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was encouraged by <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me have <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length along with <unk>
And my corn <unk> had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we look at the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern River of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it by using infrared color, suddenly the place looks as <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape of the landscape of building and building materials and the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find a <unk> ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Revolution, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'm going to try to find it to be the equivalent of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this sort of high area you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of showing you on ice, but instead of <unk> climate change, we look for layers of human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human occupation we look for human
Five meters down, under a thick mud layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date from the Middle Revolution, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also find a lot of work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, in the jewelry, these are the rocks that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back to the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but <unk> to the place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote with the favorite quote of the Middle Revolution, it was probably written 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 degrees.
So the ideas were actually really started in 1984 B.C. degrees C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly lays the quest of wings in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk> in cars.
They are competing in a bike bike career and go back to the front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles around everywhere, wheels that go on their side, the rays from the wheels that ended up in the middle places, they would take the threshold of the gate,
<unk> to the lobby, or what there is to the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. And the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I'm talking about.
They can feel your blue fur, making tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can see that it's about to get into the mouth.
They slept on one side and enter your living room.
Already in the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes and dancing over his middle <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow road, and since the oven comes to you <unk> the Man of the <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of your hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few thousand different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
They would give the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
We call entire poems within just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and she has one of the best memories in the <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
All of us who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques, invented a half thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used to memorize their <unk> and that academic <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the competition, and the <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English <unk> although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something you?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the majority of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very much with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone would be incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what extent our memory is to us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library in Salt Lake City, Lake City, <unk> guides -- was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the memory of writing about 2,000 years ago in Latin the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not such as rare as it might be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we have also changed.
We have changed culturally, and I would argue that they have changed also cognitive lives.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have us forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory, and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this worldwide.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a memory memory, to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more than the <unk>
They gave them a new cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI MRI MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow <unk> They found that in memory memory is <unk> different parts of the brain, different than others.
They actually looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is managing as an armed race where each year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of the end of the fact that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
This is illustrates by a elegant paradox called the <unk> paradox -- says this: I say two people to remember the same word, I say it to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word that I told you about a <unk>
So what would you do?
The person who said that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said their work is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were getting home when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago, in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired it like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, and he got his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon he was <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies that are <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting in.
So they wouldn't have the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, unique in the edge of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every very quickly.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What we have to do is pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or a word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space <unk>
If you were to tell you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to get them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who was sitting on the horse side horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that I would have done it, if you would have been invited to make it 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And it came up with some absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that tells you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that they want to count.
And then it would come into the kitchen, and the fourth subject that you would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them to remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for a word, which is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was simply fascinating, and I moved into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something big about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> <unk> event.
It's kind of like seeing a lot of people sitting taking on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone goes off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school, bought a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a entertaining.
I would never have expected I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- I say, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked up with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and a pair of security cookies leaving just two <unk> because the spray is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good job for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
And of course, it's cute and you can memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just so just tricks.
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be built from the memory of memory or memorize <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they do <unk>
<unk> sort of a deep processing, a kind of a whole attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do with today, is what you would not even remember that I had a memory problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is because of the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk around our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so it will just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and she lived there at the home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And so every time I saw the TV. So every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, I all saw me, and every time I went back, and I would go back and went back in a break, everybody seen.
And I was like this.
And he was notoriously insecure and I hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those kinds of emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, no division of areas, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under <unk>
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture is determines in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it so because in a building built a half thousand years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection that we have used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museum museums.
And in the 20th century in the U.S., we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, always are afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this <unk> thing has this round thing -- columns, brick -- that leave it to communicate with this <unk> the children, the property, the property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new type of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects constantly drives new technologies, new technology, new solutions for the life forms of life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so much, we get away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols themselves.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to experience the <unk> we swing the <unk> back and over and over and over over the last 300 years, and we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's about the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we zoom in at the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We put the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know that we like and <unk>
We put <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or the Italian <unk>
Maybe with an infinite number of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we will visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques from a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, the opened of this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public critics in general, were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half a thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these other shapes and wild shapes -- how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayors did the main mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This is this phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium, with other Afghanistan.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all of architecture, media media began to increase the speed of the information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transportation was <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
The technology <unk> You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is actually transported beyond its physical location beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, because architecture is moving.
It's not quite accurate to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if which I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two-year-old movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much they were <unk>
That's never going to be going back to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the invention of steel <unk> or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when we apply the link to media, it starts to swing every time faster, until you're going to be in both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the full product, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a building, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building had been built, today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there's no single response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer the mysterious creatures that are using words <unk> and kind of complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't embrace anything that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of the red brick based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally are ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings will become <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we built, is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more expensive, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to buy them.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they shape the most expensive spaces to local libraries -- the homes where we go to our children, and the step of the room to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just took a year and he started walking.
And it makes it really great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is to look at the mirror.
She actually loves his reflex.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was thinking, "When do I try to do this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm a <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And like any teenager it only wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite the fact that his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or school school says, "You don't know who to believe.
So it does a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and ask others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, which gets these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under the pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There is simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, it's always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged <unk>
What's the greatest thing in somebody's life versus what is normal in a daily context.
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who call it <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, the <unk> and the singers who are <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, developing their physical capability, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of each 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they're not nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as a result of society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in <unk> debates in the classroom, because they don't want to attract attention to their physical looks of physical thinking.
One in five are not attending to classroom at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see you good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're fine enough -- you know, a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about what looks like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gets regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be right, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think this is all for what they make more <unk> like alcohol consumption.
The perfect body search is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential is to interest each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, by itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and building their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of very <unk> programs without realizing it, we had the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also an <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects, are starting to be crucial points for any willing to provide an education in their body self-worth than work.
One education is fundamental -- but to address this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
They challenging the status of the women are seen and I talked in our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and reviews that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions not on their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as businesses, to change our culture, so that our kids will grow to be valuing their entire person, valuing our diversity, the <unk>
We have to put the people who are actually making a difference in a <unk>
So a difference in the real world, let's make them be that they go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
His <unk>
It could just be just the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, which he was <unk> because he didn't have long legs more skinny, and more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and we would recognize its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are holding us together.
But let's tell our children the truth.
<unk> the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They would bring to the self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age will become confident agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the fifth November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk> <unk>
At the first time they were initially innocent, it was innocent, but being inmate in the other charges in the company in company, they started planning attacks at about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans would be transferred by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb in 1993, in the World Trade Center, couldn't afford it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an extraordinary engineer, with a loving American mother professor Among the two they did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which really few, including even most Muslims come to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are going to be used by their convictions who thinks that we have to use all the possible means so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last week, he and some of the friends, he had been going to film training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise all of all, especially of me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a father, such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they thought that funny.
You saw in me, the same level of the destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to place a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the northern tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and transferred to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times, that instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody already was to pack and go to another city.
As I was always my new face of the class as often as I was a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but it will be the new of the <unk> silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going at home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it forever, to grow under <unk> it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I love myself to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in test my way to think, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been a <unk> victim almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had done was <unk>
Another seminal moment came when I got a summer work of summer in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out to the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay were <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the happiest and less critics I'd seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have to get treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of being homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every single night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I was helping to see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
He changed it when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to bring the violence to the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I was passionate about this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak to those acts without any sense, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. What don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has a sound of <unk> of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
<unk> anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood who project to your eyes.
And he's constantly a <unk> voice.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in it.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film and you, you, you and you.
There's nothing that makes it more directly.
At least I know that I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
<unk> is also the reason for a living.
If we weren't mindful of all, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why are these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective to it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective ways.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, we will get that vision.
The psychology is studying the <unk> behavior. The neuroscience is being studied -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of democracy.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience will answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
It wasn't <unk> to <unk>
There are no problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> internal movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors -- how they operate the <unk> how they work, how they moved, how they are adapting and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we talk, how we play <unk> all of the questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that everything is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have much to say.
I am a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a very cool chain of wonderful explanations -- so we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific worldview, the world.
I think consciousness right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem hard for consciousness.
So all the idea of the inner subjective film includes sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions, the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as building blocks space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they think of it principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the crucial list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time mass, <unk> law, and I <unk> the core laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, long, mass, then for logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> the consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts that space, time, time, the mass, the physical processes.
<unk> sometimes tell us that we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think "Oh, always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling -- some of the early feeling of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think that's so <unk>
In part this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental like space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more than a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that maybe the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is to understand consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing.
<unk> <unk> complex as a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they are supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there's a degree of information integration, the same very meaningful degree of consciousness fairly important.
But when it comes to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Now, physicists and philosophers have observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality behind the reality behind the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From the view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that you put fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you're very hungry.
I think that thinking about this tends to transform your visions, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a <unk> complicated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole whole of a whole of a whole <unk> of the entire movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
He had a very normal profile. It's a very normal under education.
I went to school, I went to my friends, I love with my younger sisters.
It was all quite normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get them to a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a real problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my <unk> my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series.
Yeah, I know. Which contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching me in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 of a kid raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs. they talk about things I would go on at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't know it. And it's not the boy that I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disability is not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to the disability.
Yes, they have been sold the lie that disability is <unk> A -- <unk> capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability you make you remarkable with.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before we <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with fiber fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term <unk> <unk> because they would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, they would have been killed by disabled people with people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> expressing that you think that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images would lead to people with disability for people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the so-called social model of disability, who tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking their bodies better.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold for this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And I honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at the moment.
However, not <unk> that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that are falling over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery on the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance to others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a pool of stairs hasn't made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen won't make the <unk> <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting up of bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 degree in a high school school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user <unk>
The disability does not make us <unk> but to question what you think to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and the professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, and so please don't get <unk>
When people really think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality needs to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step is what I carry on Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what a professional <unk> is in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field of being in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game game to 160 blood <unk> your blood <unk>
We can know that it feels like a 110 man who feels like a 110 pound of us trying to engage with all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's put some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a sub going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of time.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the soccer camp from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the equipment.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You know, you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know most of you.
The <unk> Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a roller roller <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before we run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan <unk>
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball down the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move you are in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that you carry on. You don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
You can't memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and both.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate losing games.
If you lose games as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just for <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that you are the field.
They would take the ball and <unk>
We had a <unk> <unk> suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you normally don't know it, but the system of <unk> will <unk>
It goes to the area of protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open desert.
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it lands, though, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that makes a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality for the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in somebody else's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth? for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world as being <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than notes and <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges we face, <unk> as long as us.
Thank you.
I recently ran away after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I became <unk> the end of the county in <unk> County, that includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure. It was known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an engineer who had been preparing to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much proof of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> as such, so that the each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under their <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which will provide vital organs.
Most of them die in an impact.
The ones that no, normally it <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that we had this method of suicide <unk> the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the string.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get away from life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on the edge, and at the darkest point, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking about an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but to the officials as well.
We've come a long way ever since.
Today, official officers and psychologists are trained to train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 in July <unk> when he got a call from a possible subject was sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking with a official <unk> officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was flown until two times before New Jersey to try to survive from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than that, and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And then Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had taken it.
damage damage to suicide affects a lot of people.
So I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved out suicide <unk>
What do you do?
What does it say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understanding.
You don't get <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't stop in <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances you've thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Others signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not come home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19th of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and it was <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go down the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I replied to a radio call for a possible subject was suicide bombers on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I was sitting on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she crossed the <unk> and stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half after, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day back on that lane to come back about that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, I turned it out.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did to do, and I gave it to hope and life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
I was told to talk to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I got that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing to erase the 11th events -- and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious, of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I went to the General of San Francisco General <unk> that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I knew I did have it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that his story would inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, and the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide wouldn't you think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is actually achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I have been directly involved, just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I had my hand at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the railing they just said the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that all and each of us should be working to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you fit that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone -- it's not alone.
When I became a model I felt that I was finally able to do the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> it <unk>
But in October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the ocean <unk> by the color of the skin or for the beliefs of those who surround us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo -- what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why have you always taken that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
<unk> has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never allowed me to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm bad, but why the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, my dad and a family who took me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There is a long tradition in <unk> <unk> which celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the principal of a <unk> beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she was responsible for the <unk> <unk> and that evening, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from Queen of beauty of beauty <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my request for the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you gave the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I stood up in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to perform the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary for surgery before they change the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document, means power to drive or can get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that, <unk> he turned to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that I live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global vigil for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and he stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
My network of support for my parents' network of my family in my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women <unk> that I have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents could not take it, I would take my mom and she said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes I worked out. It's just not. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned to give us a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that task is not block, and there should be a space that allowed people to do, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are often known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who read him for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> his efforts in 2011, and the <unk> National Prize became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when at birth a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not for his father, not for his mother.
<unk> comes from your <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mentor of suffering, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays at home and school admits her brothers.
Up until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and he can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence -- when 13 years old, it's an agreement that comes from your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you gave the code of that honor, honor, they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this piece of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and her happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and decisions of the elderly even if they don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man -- he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I came back, all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half, the <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school <unk>
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the child life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One meeting is that it has entered the world in the dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they came up with the form of tourist caves, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was going to sit down with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to get more and more space for women in society.
But we find ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political and economic activities and social.
Hundreds of schools.
Girls <unk>
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
Musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October October 2012, was shot by <unk> in the head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he was sent to my ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't tell you."
Let's get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe migraine headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I am fine with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her to resist the hardest moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
You know, when he didn't take his task.
He fights with his brothers, and I'm very excited about that.
People ask me to ask me, "What is special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so courageous and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
He didn't cut their wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you gave you to a brain operation.
You're still as smart or not?
It won't be like this, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, matter, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if you didn't take nothing, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to live with life.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I could try to get the doses, <unk> because there really doesn't have a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started trying with <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the dose dramatically -- my sense of who was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and normal chemicals for a man, and I was surprised by looking at how I would play my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was a little bit <unk> to fix a problem I had on the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they need to do, and since I get better on men.
What I was trying to do with the adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of the key point -- how I can have those images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> -- new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who are <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works for me is simple: for most of us, images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I get to find the right point and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these very quickly into the mental images, of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie was able to use their imagination only to run the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of achieving this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups leading in neuroscience.
They both used technology and image MRI devices, to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The center of the center shows the scan of the brain that same individual as it comes in, looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were tracking their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to the video sequence.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as they were going on, a new <unk>
The computer -- using only brain information to look at the scan of the scan -- to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us.
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This is conducted with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and its resolution up as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer you for that.
A lot of them are proposing new projection techniques for imagery, and even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of <unk> first we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in our resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- make it better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different ways, like a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to do really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions to coding and <unk> in the belonged and the FM radio sets on MRI systems.
At once, instead of a single magnetic field they provide chemical patterns, magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of radio frequencies -- we can actually increase the information a massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have few more options to open up this door.
But anyway, choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time that they love or say someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to put in life in life.
I think it's a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can change the experience of having the experience of being lived and having come out of that closet.
It's fear, and we don't like to happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> I was a restaurant in the city, and he was there, and I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I didn't have my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> giving <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had <unk> my head by a little bit, I would ask you usually a child -- "Hey, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there was a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
I should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues at the table.  I had the dating of Betty <unk>
The quotes of Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took deep down and I went down and my back one year-old girl with a pink dress with a pink dress looking at me, which is not a challenge for a feminist <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you kid or <unk>
And so I breathe down again -- again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a boy, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am more of the kind of a girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why to go out of my closet -- it was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared on bank meetings -- it's harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five years of five years you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We must stop to classify what it's hard to do with respect to what it is difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are made -- a closet that's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, and a dress and a <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant <unk> prepared to fight any four years old in the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my <unk> gay, and the moving only muscle is the scarier I've ever done.
My family, my whole whole friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so much time, but if you don't spears that <unk> they will kill you.
One of my most memorable Times launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I made my Lady of lady of honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women pointed out, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay account had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
So what is your <unk> <unk> program.
Our favorite <unk> program.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes to prove desperately for his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses my husband <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and find out the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask to ask someone, it's <unk>
If you are authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you do.
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three early principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through a gay perspective, but understand that what it implies to go out of anything else is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  <unk> the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can go out and hurt safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet I find a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel that they feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of it is so interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of the computer pioneered like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the Earth's intelligence -- but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have very long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, like <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien of a alien that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet, <unk> planet will stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that will embrace the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different themes and <unk> together, asked a number of years ago: there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or keeping the open choices with a certain force -- with the diversity of possible <unk> Yeah, even in an impending time future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so having to look at this equation, it's natural <unk> What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to be more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of entropy long-term in any system that you can find in.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests -- playing human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Moreover, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling ends up opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic development and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable into a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections on a social network where friends are constantly getting constantly and keeps success a very connected.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its way from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable on defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of action negotiation by successfully increasing assets under their economic management.
This ability of risk risk has huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of smart cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if you were going to be smart machines -- there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they need to try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the other possible future is a fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, instead of being the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, that is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
So we're at a tipping point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points around the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the dim <unk> of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that gets to us.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
So all together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
At turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
This was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for millennia, for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale of global <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I am not a scientist scientist, not <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more you look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet just discovered and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images, you remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> ideas compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> <unk> and higher places.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets drag with a great and sad <unk> and the implication and the belief that we would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is really livable the Earth.
So I like exploration exploration, I'm deep in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is kind of imagine that the captain of Titanic will comment on us that the <unk> truth will have place later in the <unk>
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the preservation of the earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're just getting closer from home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, by having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of the alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to live in between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that we can protect this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will be able to save us ourselves, but human preservation and <unk> <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there was the <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to come, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early to Europe in Europe to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and <unk>
They are expensive, but sure that we don't even more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought despite the circumstances, I was going to be over.
I'm <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rhythm, <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put it on their place, that would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if things happen, bad things -- which is the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared shared with me that he had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this for a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At home, <unk> a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the trees are <unk> where the tribes and friends are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and you still find your nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For her <unk> a particular drawer for you.
For your reading <unk> a particular <unk>
If you're going to get a place and they're <unk> with it your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card card leave of driving, and I <unk> you to get them into the cloud.
If these things get lost or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps more stressful situations than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making, and in fact for the decision for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease attack, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and you may even know that you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and the companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or have to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the <unk> researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke, or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, forget about the <unk> <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> beating muscle pain and <unk> pain.
But a moment.
So remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out <unk> for the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they needed to be <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value by the crash, but actually this number that we need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> Project <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects we only have a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions you can make you have to take a conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a long life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can shift from opinion on the heat of the time, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the <unk> lunch.
Unfortunately, one of the things that's going through the window during those stress moments is the logical thought of rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail with time.
The idea is to think about the future of how those <unk> can be able to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the damage, or to prevent things wrong with the first place.
<unk> on the snow night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination with a combination of combination along the door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read with.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical signal.
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more geologists
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be, never really <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1800s, and over the course of time, it mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating them from not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
All of this I call it <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label on what the average person does.
I'm a <unk> <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
They were going to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to make it with my thumb that it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artwork in there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It goes to <unk> more of art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a <unk> way, or I would really experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that I had taught me as a sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a little bit of a person listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it might well be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could be <unk>
I chose to make me angry.
There's massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my core voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal to the same and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in our current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could put it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capturing and expressing fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you one metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different <unk> parameters,
If you map a different parameter for every finger while the piano is playing the piano, like facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and like that, while the piano is on the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it comes to just a button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only one button would change the chord that would create a completely different meaning of it.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, they can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signature signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it up.
This is the day."
If you look at it, and you get the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can say to be said to be <unk>
All virtue.
This is the whole night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the third two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, let's get it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
You see <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of them are high.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all of the cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third point, please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. Everybody occur in your head and the chest. But they make it quite different indeed.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, we live in a very tight world.
And just because the <unk> does not have a social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear about music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you give them everything, but then you have to take it up.
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
By getting older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other people.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teach people and invention in the Chinese school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we had the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today over 80 percent of the oceans, they contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic chunks to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> work on <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools are really great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic pieces just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids get a lot of a lot with the robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turns out light and chambers on accessories and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it.
I can research my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
You see the news, they see the Internet, and they get involved with this <unk>
A child, maybe 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands of <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is going on, the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and oil is also brown color and when it's <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be attached to all kinds of substances that produce different amounts of things that can help you identify what there's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help make other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a hardest problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we made a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant nearby to water.
And today, according to the reports of an average of 300 tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the disappeared coast of the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently of other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course, they didn't get the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data that we were talking about, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We could actually notice that the radioactive powder is going to fall from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate of <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching up to a 1.5 miles of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen of the fishermen of the zone we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has become more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try and solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became such a small way, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and made it in the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the Hong Kong center, and it's a place where we can work with wood and metal -- chemistry -- a little bit of biology, you basically can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or we can help in mobility in the age of advanced age, transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> awful -- but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens creators, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and the people, and so I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of one silk thread is made.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One sits on the environment, the other thing I believed him.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
<unk> was a <unk> tool.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information for each cell to work and to protect them.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects, trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other mostly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that gets gradually gradually through the variation of <unk>
Here is a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect working on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the <unk> between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right one, analytics and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My job on its simplest level is trying to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and going down to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment, in history, a rare moment -- where four disciplines that offer designers to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe in.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales on a big scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> scope of the diameter of the diameter with a <unk> base that one day is not very distant to print <unk> buildings, which is made by <unk> genetically embraced <unk>
Here we have <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab region, and has created a screen where every aperture is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> fashion <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
So this helmet combines stiff and stiff materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high high resolution, and to the <unk> instruments, allowing us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic <unk> one chair as comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern -- becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised a religious <unk> but when I was a young man, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and get to define a lot about what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends on the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects get made out of a <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to organize the kind of material from the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced by organisms.
We think that if we can tune in to <unk> your <unk> we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of husks of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are lists, you can dry it dry to find a natural shape to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used for <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet -- a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems that are no problems and <unk> and <unk>
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that was made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed for <unk> put up in the sea, <unk> life and placed it on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration of our next exploration of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their <unk>
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid alchemy only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops -- <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns light into sugar, the other gas and produces biofuels and useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a only channel that it looks like to your digestive tract that will help the flow of these bacteria and that they take their function of way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, including the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> you have more transparent channels.
This system is <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our very small intestine as well.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are last creatures of fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if the design happens if the design is going to be <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase living stuff.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the knitting tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology material.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material into layers.
They also know that nature doesn't make it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers into each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes on in the environment, creates a structure of <unk> and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of cocoon of silk.
However, by putting silk worm in a flat patch -- not inside a box, we realized that we would take a flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape the sheer silk without boiling a single <unk>
You know, <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process into the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to the darkest areas and that's why we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat -- it will decrease the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to engage with us.
We put them very carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as you grow up, <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and it was right.
Al silk -- biological silk -- the silk -- <unk> <unk> all of this pavilion and its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk path.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty empty.
If the last design of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature to a nature of the design of us, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if what you want to be from <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but it had <unk>
In school, I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and making websites -- I also played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And I really like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was excited about something else, which is totally different, and I was going to focus on it, and I'm going to let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me much anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because of nothing.
I was concerned to fear engagement, or being dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to leave you then.
Ask themselves, where you learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
And we ask the first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what we would go to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is given us over and over again as you grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what sleep does.
Why?
Now, if this issue is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of anything they might be.
In fact, it does right in the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are doing it <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor actually turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different themes that show its curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of creative interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide up in three parts and multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms to be used by the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the evening of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It will take any term you like it or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization and travel, and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
It comes from new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their background, can be accessing a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we are <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been many times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to test things new and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and a full-time writer.
As a black pianist was an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when his <unk> and this ability to write the compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely <unk> a loss of time to go into what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end, you will.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of a website, other web designer designer -- sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The journal <unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the marketplace, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come out of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas in practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> largely is encouraging them to be more like their <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart heart, then you take it through all the media.
That's where you will get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize is one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for these <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner <unk> leads us to a most authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world will <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric physicist.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I would take care of her, until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, he did a autopsy. And they found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were going to have been alive today, we couldn't give her to her more help than she <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has come a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for <unk> <unk> for HIV, for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made progress on the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their <unk> or how we have Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or be dear Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's costs costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimers disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its cost costs -- increase in five times in 2050, as the age of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of the itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a number more than deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years of all, we all have the scientists, make Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with a drug patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to releasing a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by waterborne transmission, significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made from protein.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places on paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what block is complex, like defuse a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it does, and then create a drug that would do.
Until recently, most of the cables have been reduced and waiting for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical chemicals, physical engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new type of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have molecules of protein that they stick to each other, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stages, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years old, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from overcoming the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's disease often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't actually a single genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the Lower column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is about a psychological study -- designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience of testing it itself one night of last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple -- two strangers will come up to make 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number one: When was the last time you start to start with another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are getting more and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, or it was to her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a few detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to prove this study, with someone who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send her to the column in the column in a few months later.
That was published in January, and it's now in August, so I suppose some of you would probably ask, keep together <unk>
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before he was publishing the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been writing about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand noticed.
And that got a good care burden in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was released online on Friday at night, and then the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called "Today Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with respect for own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or write what every day for weeks, they were always, they were doing the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email to my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the scale of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers to test the study on different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did about to make a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and he refused to take pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> of the <unk> process -- a range that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they really wanted to know whether they were able to produce love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether to live together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal focus, between college students, using what they did, called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But the study did work.
The participants were even closer to do that, several later studies, also used poor protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid mode of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they used it to be used among people from opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I took last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of full eye contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me and said to me with <unk> I tried to have tried -- I tried to have a tried and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk>
And I said, "You want to say that you give you from the person with whom I <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
They knew that they were able to get better know after testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I found myself with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which was virtually my whole adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I moved to science.
I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and hoped that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just took for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I approached my romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to me then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what we <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably well to demand for me.
What I'm looking for of the love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I will keep going to be a strong fundamentalism for the person I love.
It may be that this guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told over the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to somehow mitigate something at risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version of the story that you can still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, would submit that we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when cutting and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's a <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because I'm not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to do.
I didn't think, how many times would we take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and kind of fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't know.
And what we <unk> and what maybe spending my life searching is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy to implicit in the title of my piece, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have to change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary -- and that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
And the city of New York takes a time.  Something that really affected me, but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wood box and put a dollar bill a dollar, and a pen and a fork somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of these <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's kind of hard because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> which was Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened in the opposite of the opposite of a way it seemed to rise of size, as if it was <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things my life, trying to figure out the stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow to draw just like you do around a body in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> of those who can make an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend in dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of resin with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing -- I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass glass, similar to the drawing on one window into one window and another window and another window and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked. And so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures with the heads of animals are heading for <unk> ready to suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits up oil in a hand while in the other hand, they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
But anyway, his tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made of cards of terrorists in 1986.
You've got them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
And this leads me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, divide together.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk> the entrance to <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads of heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a painter, a musician, a writer, a museum, a museum, a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
And we would take the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you are living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts from countries in the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things on sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill that has effect on pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
I'm going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> in your body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and to increase the blood cells.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects in its negative, because in the time that it takes to the current <unk> they get <unk> and worse even for the time it takes to its destiny, which is where it is the most important: in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph node the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood blood of the patients that are tested to regulate drug drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life <unk> by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> and diabetes surgery can be used for anything else -- including transportation transport of drugs.
Indeed, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, that open up and closing almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking yourself, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before even realizing it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, that is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the pill that releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not shoot behind.
My goal is to understand better to be better in these automatic business agents and studying ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to violent confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the state and actors and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace <unk> between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of conflict of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody is looking at what they do when they weren't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the decade of 1980, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than simply shooting.
These are multitasking from.
They would take a complex machine of <unk> stations of radio, channels of television, websites of the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex concentration of funds without <unk> but through <unk> business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger relationships with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they run out of professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for providing security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for population.
But in general, provide social services it means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in a Palestinian Hamas cannot understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps from the government, and they emerge as armed and armed and political and political struggle participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones, are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
You take part of a ground, run all of their function, collect the trash -- run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world in the state of <unk> and hybrids and the weaker the ones are states, like in the Middle East in the Middle East in the current East <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools.
We had that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and raise the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will understand better what incentives to deliver the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can make some <unk> but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that gap from government that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept in terms of the <unk> label would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a fan, but quite bad.
And therefore I was struck by a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal trick meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women treat women all over the world and the anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who could be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a very unpleasant word.
I grew up as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much to self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, a criminal, and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same pay.
We have a right to travel around the world as it will be free to <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it in a easy way, and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for checks or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to get into account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender expression and <unk> social condition skills, and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we can tell ourselves the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession to me.
When I <unk> the job, I hear rap music <unk>
Even though the letter degrades to women and sad and the classic <unk> classical of the yin -- yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually have your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical connection.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do,   -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> of junk and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> fantasies about the fairy fairy fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last last name of his husband, it's his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
We put this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women color, the gay <unk> and <unk> for white women and <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist idea.
Also the next thing is this: I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we are hoping for perfection.
When we get together, we take them very much taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I consider myself to get rid of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is to be afraid of fear not to be able to fulfill the little expectations of it.
Take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music Day, 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show you see this star in the pop side of the pop side of nowhere, and do knowing women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started <unk> debates if they were <unk> it was not a feminist.
It was going to be able to, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, and we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going to be much beyond sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question or more well, a breakthrough more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We should recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little more brave.
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier to provide a supply supply by limitless.
These artists are not going to change their way to speak about women in their songs until the change is affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> girls and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
Where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will become a much easier way to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema anywhere else when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help us to be even more like us are empowered to overcome the barriers to decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little decisions of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to the people in the power of CEOs and movie producers and music, <unk> the people who can make large decisions and more courageous, to create a lasting and more significant change.
We can also say with courage our question bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist will not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say that, especially because <unk> my voice was stolen -- and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
I set out my voice, and after all I didn't think about me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I took me into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and we also discovered that if it was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I am a feminist fan, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you more need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal to a child with an immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were supposed to fear something were supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism, and vaccines <unk> entirely, and marked by being a fraud held by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most of intelligent scientists that the vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world still remain <unk> that vaccines will put in danger of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism estimates in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her create develop their entire professional life without seeing a single case.
During decades, estimates of prevalence followed just as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> for funds like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as a epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Disease Center what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman who seeks in the face of her two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the storytelling of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health care.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a Child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> a private worlds, <unk> to people around it, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, he declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while you pick up references of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 children to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a child flu is caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully on a refrigerator and not <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned out two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents were happy to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> clinical psychologist in London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as she had no support support services without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend at the National Service Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
<unk> a prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse ways.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or the <unk> of the <unk>
And in other ways, these kids don't have <unk> and <unk> like <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How didn't nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time, nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in their own work.
There was not even a translation of the English translation -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German talking German, and he did it for her.
The document gives an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a boarding school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in your clinic started with music exercises and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> ways of support and spaces adapted over the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's ones called them their little teachers, and they started to help in the development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> a surprising variety of injuries, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was further down there until the success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes don't go into <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked backstage to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance is <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four prizes on the <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical tests, to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that this stuff was hoping that this stuff out there, making people with autism and their families finally supported the support and the services that they were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines by the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful story -- and <unk> credible story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Of sure, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on deck to <unk> the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
